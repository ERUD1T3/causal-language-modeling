But far aboe the loelest, Hero shn'd, And stole away th'enchanted gazer's mnd; For lke seanymphs'neglng harmony, So was her beauty to the standersby; Nor that nghtwanderng, pale, and watery star (When yawnng dragons draw her thrlng car From Latmus'mount up to the gloomy sky, Where, crown'd wth blazng lght and majesty, She proudly sts)more oerrules the flood Than she the hearts of those that near her stood. Een as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase, Wretched on's shaggyfooted race, ncens'd wth saage heat, gallop aman From steep pnebearng mountans to the plan, So ran the people forth to gaze upon her, And all that ew'd her were enamour'd on her. And as n fury of a dreadful fght, Ther fellows beng slan or put to flght, Poor solders stand wth fear of death deadstrooken, So at her presence all surprs'd and tooken, Awat the sentence of her scornful eyes; He whom she faours les; the other des.

Of crystal shnng far the paement was; The town of Sestos call'd t enus'glass: There mght you see the gods n sundry shapes, Commttng heady rots, ncest, rapes: For know, that underneath ths radant flower Was Danae's statue n a brazen tower, Joe slyly stealng from hs sster's bed, To dally wth dalan Ganmed, And for hs loe Europa bellowng loud, And tumblng wth the ranbow n a cloud; Bloodquaffng Mars heang the ron net, Whch lmpng ulcan and hs Cyclops set; Loe kndlng fre, to burn such towns as Troy, Sylanus weepng for the loely boy That now s turn'd nto a cypress tree, Under whose shade the woodgods loe to be. And n the mdst a sler altar stood: There Hero, sacrfcng turtles'blood, al'd to the ground, elng her eyelds close; And modestly they opened as she rose. Thence flew Loe's arrow wth the golden head; And thus Leander was enamoured.
