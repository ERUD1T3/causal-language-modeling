{"author": "Ezra_Pound", "content": "May for my own self song's truth reckon, Journey's jargon, how n harsh days Hardshp endured oft. Btter breast-cares hae abded, Known on my keel many a care's hold, And dre sea-surge, and there oft spent Narrow nghtwatch ngh the shp's head Whle she tossed close to clffs. Coldly afflcted, My feet were by frost benumbed. Chll ts chans are; chafng sghs Hew my heart round and hunger begot Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not That he on dry land loelest leth, Lst how , care-wretched, on ce-cold sea, Weathered the wnter, wretched outcast Depred of my knsmen; Hung wth hard ce-flakes, where hal-scur flew, There heard naught sae the harsh sea And ce-cold wae, at whles the swan cres, Dd for my games the gannet's clamour, Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter, The mews'sngng all my mead-drnk. Storms, on the stone-clffs beaten, fell on the stern n cy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed Wth spray on hs pnon. Not any protector May make merry man farng needy. Ths he lttle belees, who aye n wnsome lfe Abdes'md burghers some heay busness, Wealthy and wne-flushed, how weary oft Must bde aboe brne. Neareth nghtshade, snoweth from north, Frost froze the land, hal fell on earth then Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now The heart's thought that on hgh streams The salt-way tumult traerse alone. Moaneth alway my mnd's lust That fare forth, that afar hence Seek out a foregn fastness. For ths there's no mood-lofty man oer earth's mdst, Not though he be gen hs good, but wll hae n hs youth greed; Nor hs deed to the darng, nor hs kng to the fathful But shall hae hs sorrow for sea-fare Whateer hs lord wll. He hath not heart for harpng, nor n rng-hang Nor wnsomeness to wfe, nor world's delght Nor any wht else sae the wae's slash, Yet longng comes upon hm to fare forth on the water. Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berres, Felds to farness, land fares brsker, All ths admonsheth man eager of mood, The heart turns to trael so that he then thnks On flood-ways to be far departng. Cuckoo calleth wth gloomy cryng, He sngeth summerward, bodeth sorrow, The btter heart's blood. Burgher knows not He the prosperous man what some perform Where wanderng them wdest draweth. So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock, My mood'md the mere-flood, Oer the whale's acre, would wander wde. On earth's shelter cometh oft to me, Eager and ready, the cryng lone-flyer, Whets for the whale-path the heart rresstbly, O'er tracks of ocean; seeng that anyhow My lord deems to me ths dead lfe On loan and on land, belee not That any earth-weal eternal standeth Sae there be somewhat calamtous That, ere a man's tde go, turn t to twan. Dsease or oldness or sword-hate Beats out the breath from doom-grpped body. And for ths, eery earl whateer, for those speakng after Laud of the lng, boasteth some last word, That he wll work ere he pass onward, Frame on the far earth'ganst foes hs malce, Darng ado,... So that all men shall honour hm after And hs laud beyond them reman'md the Englsh, Aye, for eer, a lastng lfe's-blast, Delght md the doughty. Days lttle durable, And all arrogance of earthen rches, There come now no kngs nor Csars Nor gold-gng lords lke those gone. Howe'er n mrth most magnfed, Whoe'er led n lfe most lordlest, Drear all ths ecellence, delghts undurable! Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth. Tomb hdeth trouble. The blade s layed low. Earthly glory ageth and seareth. No man at all gong the earth's gat, But age fares aganst hm, hs face paleth, Grey-hared he groaneth, knows gone companons, Lordly men are to earth o'ergen, Nor may he then the flesh-coer, whose lfe ceaseth, Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry, Nor str hand nor thnk n md heart, And though he strew the grae wth gold, Hs born brothers, ther bured bodes Be an unlkely treasure hoard."}
