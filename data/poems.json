At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the far, Whom young Apollo courted for her har, And offer'd as a dower hs burnng throne, Where she could st for men to gaze upon. The outsde of her garments were of lawn, The lnng purple slk, wth glt stars drawn; Her wde sleees green, and border'd wth a groe, Where enus n her naked glory stroe To please the careless and dsdanful eyes Of proud Adons, that before her les; Her krtle blue, whereon was many a stan, Made wth the blood of wretched loers slan. Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath, From whence her el reach'd to the ground beneath; Her el was artfcal flowers and leaes, Whose workmanshp both man and beast decees; Many would prase the sweet smell as she past, When'twas the odour whch her breath forth cast; And there for honey bees hae sought n an, And beat from thence, hae lghted there agan. About her neck hung chans of pebblestone, Whch lghten'd by her neck, lke damonds shone. She ware no gloes; for nether sun nor wnd Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mnd, Or warm or cool them, for they took delght To play upon those hands, they were so whte. Buskns of shells, all sler'd, used she, And branch'd wth blushng coral to the knee; Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold, Such as the world would wonder to behold: Those wth sweet water oft her handmad flls, Whch as she went, would chrrup through the blls. Some say, for her the farest Cupd pn'd, And lookng n her face, was strooken blnd. But ths s true; so lke was one the other, As he magn'd Hero was hs mother; And oftentmes nto her bosom flew, About her naked neck hs bare arms threw, And lad hs chldsh head upon her breast, And wth stll pantng rock'd there took hs rest. So loelyfar was Hero, enus'nun, As Nature wept, thnkng she was undone, Because she took more from her than she left, And of such wondrous beauty her bereft: Therefore, n sgn her treasure suffer'd wrack, Snce Hero's tme hath half the world been black."}

Of crystal shnng far the paement was; The town of Sestos call'd t enus'glass: There mght you see the gods n sundry shapes, Commttng heady rots, ncest, rapes: For know, that underneath ths radant flower Was Danae's statue n a brazen tower, Joe slyly stealng from hs sster's bed, To dally wth dalan Ganmed, And for hs loe Europa bellowng loud, And tumblng wth the ranbow n a cloud; Bloodquaffng Mars heang the ron net, Whch lmpng ulcan and hs Cyclops set; Loe kndlng fre, to burn such towns as Troy, Sylanus weepng for the loely boy That now s turn'd nto a cypress tree, Under whose shade the woodgods loe to be. And n the mdst a sler altar stood: There Hero, sacrfcng turtles'blood, al'd to the ground, elng her eyelds close; And modestly they opened as she rose. Thence flew Loe's arrow wth the golden head; And thus Leander was enamoured.

Of crystal shnng far the paement was; The town of Sestos call'd t enus'glass: There mght you see the gods n sundry shapes, Commttng heady rots, ncest, rapes: For know, that underneath ths radant flower Was Danae's statue n a brazen tower, Joe slyly stealng from hs sster's bed, To dally wth dalan Ganmed, And for hs loe Europa bellowng loud, And tumblng wth the ranbow n a cloud; Bloodquaffng Mars heang the ron net, Whch lmpng ulcan and hs Cyclops set; Loe kndlng fre, to burn such towns as Troy, Sylanus weepng for the loely boy That now s turn'd nto a cypress tree, Under whose shade the woodgods loe to be. And n the mdst a sler altar stood: There Hero, sacrfcng turtles'blood, al'd to the ground, elng her eyelds close; And modestly they opened as she rose. Thence flew Loe's arrow wth the golden head; And thus Leander was enamoured.

Btter breastcares hae abded, Known on my keel many a care's hold, And dre seasurge, and there oft spent Narrow nghtwatch ngh the shp's head Whle she tossed close to clffs. Coldly afflcted, My feet were by frost benumbed. Chll ts chans are; chafng sghs Hew my heart round and hunger begot Mereweary mood. Lest man know not That he on dry land loelest leth, Lst how , carewretched, on cecold sea, Weathered the wnter, wretched outcast Depred of my knsmen; Hung wth hard ceflakes, where halscur flew, There heard naught sae the harsh sea And cecold wae, at whles the swan cres, Dd for my games the gannet's clamour, Seafowls, loudness was for me laughter, The mews'sngng all my meaddrnk. Storms, on the stoneclffs beaten, fell on the stern n cy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed Wth spray on hs pnon. Not any protector May make merry man farng needy. Ths he lttle belees, who aye n wnsome lfe Abdes'md burghers some heay busness, Wealthy and wneflushed, how weary oft Must bde aboe brne. Neareth nghtshade, snoweth from north, Frost froze the land, hal fell on earth then Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now The heart's thought that on hgh streams The saltway tumult traerse alone. Moaneth alway my mnd's lust That fare forth, that afar hence Seek out a foregn fastness. For ths there's no moodlofty man oer earth's mdst, Not though he be gen hs good, but wll hae n hs youth greed; Nor hs deed to the darng, nor hs kng to the fathful But shall hae hs sorrow for seafare Whateer hs lord wll. He hath not heart for harpng, nor n rnghang Nor wnsomeness to wfe, nor world's delght Nor any wht else sae the wae's slash, Yet longng comes upon hm to fare forth on the water. Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berres, Felds to farness, land fares brsker, All ths admonsheth man eager of mood, The heart turns to trael so that he then thnks On floodways to be far departng. Cuckoo calleth wth gloomy cryng, He sngeth summerward, bodeth sorrow, The btter heart's blood. Burgher knows not He the prosperous man what some perform Where wanderng them wdest draweth. So that but now my heart burst from my breastlock, My mood'md the mereflood, Oer the whale's acre, would wander wde.
