We were promised a better life in our home countries, where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently. Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury. Some corporations are more efficient than government, but their motivation is not the health or the wellbeing of the people; it's only about profit. Everything elsetheir image, their human resources, their public relationsonly exist to protect the reality behind it. Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition, that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us, and so they privatized everything. Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture, by those who never had our interests at heart. They didn't care about our survival or wellbeingthey just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources. They took everything we built and made it theirs, first by creating racism to justify slavery, building the capital for capitalism, and then when they gave us what they call liberty, everything we had was still owned by them. Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy, and that we would have freedom, but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom, the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table. Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God.\n(Open your eyes before you die)\nAnd while some used missionaries and donations to offset this abuse, other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes, using war, disease, and sanctions that killed millions. They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, because their loyalty was to those who enabled them, restored them and kept them in power. They became the bastard children of American industry, kleptocracy, governments of thievery. They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits. The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy, and even overthrow democratically elected governments. And so the age of revolution began again. They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market. But the free market has never been free, because the market does not regulate itself. It is manipulated like a puppet, and it survives because of its image. Destroy the image, and the enemy will die. Such is the same in the rap industry. But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World. When they need new assets, new artists to prostitute a sideins, and put on a shelf to use their songs; when they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, they came to the underground, to the Third World. They took our culture, our property and our industry and our resources, even using our own people to help them exploit us. But behind the mask of efficiency, they claimed that we need them to succeed. They're no better than us. Their economic advertising was always a lie. A few got rich, but most were given an illusion of wealth, almost as if it was designed for failure. Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music, so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, glittering rented jewelry, the cars, the IMF loans, the seeds with suicide jeans, 20year contracts, and oil blood money. Build your defenses, my independent brothers and sisters. Theyll stop at nothing to get what they want. They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward. But the super powers are no less corrupt; they've just learned to disguise it better, cause they fix elections too, they embezzle tax money, they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit. And when there's enough at stake, history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own president.\n(WAKE UP)"}

For if ever there was the absence of Homeland Security, it is seen in the gritty roots of HipHop. For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them, that they are at best tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison. They grew up hungry, hated, and unloved, and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry. One senses very little hope above the personal goals of wealth to climb above the pit of poverty. In the broader society, the opposite is true, for here, more than any other place on earth, wealth is so wide spread and so bountiful that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world. They're very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure and homeland security is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military intelligence, or the U.S Department of Justice. They're just words, they have very little relationship to reality. Now do you feel safer now? Do you think you will anytime soon?

And it was just little by little we got to know, just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being...finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...\nSo, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys.
